## The Biggest Mistake Beginners Make

Most beginners start with Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) because it's what textbooks and schools teach.

But here's the problem:
MSA is mainly used for news, formal writing, and official speeches. People don't speak it in daily life.

That's why many learners study for months and still can't order coffee or hold a simple conversation.

## Which Arabic Should You Learn First?

### Spoken Arabic (Dialects)

If your goal is conversation, you should start with a spoken dialect.
